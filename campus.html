      Life at Marist outside the classroom offers a wealth of opportunity for
      personal growth and development that supports and enhances students'
      academic experience. From exciting trips to Broadway shows to volunteering
      at a local elementary school or food pantry, getting a massage at the
      annual Wellness Fair, attending a workshop on stress management in a
      residence hall, or participating with hundreds of fellow students in the
      Relay for Life, there are countless activities from which to choose.
      Consistent with the Marist Mission, the sense of community and the sense
      of service to others is important to us. Both the philosophy and the staff
      in the Division of Student Affairs support the development of the whole
      person: intellectually, socially, physically, and spiritually. Our
      programs and services are designed to promote self-discovery, leadership
      development, healthy behaviors, and social responsibility as well as
      enjoyment. You'll make great friends, you'll learn about yourself and the
      world, and you'll grow in all aspects of your life. And we'll be there
      with support along the way, with professionals like mentors, residence
      directors, counselors, security, and medical staff should the need arise.
